Sweden said on Sunday it had recalled its ambassador to Guatemala for consultations, citing the political situation in the country and bilateral relations Foreign Minister <person>Margot Wallstrom</person> said.

Relations plunged last May when Guatemala gave ambassador <person>Anders Kompass</person> 30 days to leave, unhappy about Sweden's contribution to the UN's International Committee on Imprisonment in Guatemala (CICIG) to investigate corruption and organized crime in the Central American country.

Guatemalan President <person>Jimmy Morales</person> notified the UN in January that he was closing down the anti-corruption mission, which started in 2007 and has worked with the prosecutor's office on graft and organized crime cases, AFP reported.

In May, Guatemala accused <person>Kompass</person> of saying Guatemalan society itself was corrupt.

<person>Kompass</person> is a former UN official who turned whistleblower five years ago over the sexual abuse of minors by French UN troops in the Central African Republic and resigned from the organization in 2016 saying wrongdoers had not been held to account.
