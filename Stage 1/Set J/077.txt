<person>Eduardo Balarezo</person>, another attorney for "<person>El Chapo</person>," said that, if true, the juror's admissions in the VICE interview indicates <person>Guzman</person> "did not get a fair trial."
"The information apparently accessed by the jury is highly prejudicial, uncorroborated and inadmissible â€” all reasons why the Court repeatedly warned the jury against using social media and the internet to investigate the case," <person>Balarezo</person> said in a statement.
Balarezo said he and other members of Guzman's defense team "will review all available options before deciding on a course of action."
The U.S. Department of Justice for the Eastern District of New York had no immediate comment.
<person>Guzman</person>'s legal team had already said it will appeal the conviction before the juror was interviewed by VICE.
