One half of Arab Strap, purveyors of seedy Glaswegian sprechgesang, <person>Aidan Moffat</person> is an unlikely Santa figure. Voluminously bearded he may be, but he is more likely to mutter profanities at a crying toddler than inquire as to their heart’s desire. <person>Moffat</person> and multi-instrumentalist <person>Hubbert</person> released their debut duo album earlier this year, called Here Lies the Body – that’s how jolly they are. Yet in 2011, <person>Moffat</person> released a Christmas-themed EP, the better to drive home the irony: a tinny disco bagatelle full of degradation.
Here is a very different sequel, 10 seasonal song-stories in which the lugubrious <person>Moffat</person> goes for existential bleakness, with just the odd holly berry of warmth, hope and wry humour. The Fir Tree is typical: the harrowing tale of a sweet-natured evergreen, excitedly taken from its forest and showered in seasonal warmth by a family before being thrown into a cold shed and violently dismembered for firewood.
There is, though, a great deal of understanding here for human fallibility – “come all ye unfaithful”, calls the title track – and the difficulties of the season (Lonely This Christmas). The consolation extends to the music, which features guest strings and clarinet and non-judgmental succour.
