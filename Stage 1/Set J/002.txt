<person>Roman Catholics</person> who were sexually abused by clergy are insisting that decisive actions to confront the decades-long problem of pedophile priests and church cover-ups must come out of an upcoming Vatican summit.
A founding member of the advocacy group Ending Clergy Abuse, <person>Peter Isely</person>, contended Sunday that <person>Pope Francis</person> is "facing resistance" from top Vatican officials as he prepares to convene bishops from around the world.
"Let me tell you what it was like to try and have to resist that priest when I was a boy who was sexually assaulting me," <person>Isely</person> said. "So whatever difficulty for him or discomfort this is for anybody in the papal palace, it is nothing compared to what survivors have had to undergo."
<person>Isely</person> offered his perspective in an interview with The Associated Press near St. Peter's Square shortly before <person>Francis</person> spoke of the importance of the Feb. 21-24 event on protecting children and teenagers in the church,.
