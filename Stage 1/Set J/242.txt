Tech giants like Facebook and Amazon have already committed to building data centers in Sweden, and other international players including Interxion, Equinix, Sungard, Tieto, Digiplex, and Hydro 66 have made data centers an increasingly important industry for the country.

“We are very excited to be working with The Local to give Sweden’s tech scene – and the data center industry in particular – greater visibility internationally,” says <person>Tomas Sokolnicki</person>, Head of Data Centers by Sweden at Business Sweden.

“The Local is daily reading for foreign IT professionals based in Sweden as well as decision makers in other countries considering investments in Sweden. Having stories published in English alongside The Local’s flow of daily news from Sweden means we can broaden the reach of our own data center stories”, says <person>Patrik Öhlund</person>, CEO of Node Pole .

Sweden’s data center industry is expected to bring economic effects of 50bn SEK by 2025 and account for almost 30,000 jobs, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group commissioned by Business Sweden.

“Information about data centers isn’t only about infrastructure, energy, and cooling systems. We want to educate readers about the whole eco-system for data centers; connectivity, as well as cloud computing, Big Data, the Internet of Things, and high-performance computing,” says <person>Mattias Fridström</person>, Chief Evangelist at Telia Carrier .

With more than 1.2 million monthly readers around the world, The Local Sweden is the country’s largest English-language news channel and the primary channel for non-Swedish speakers to learn about Sweden – wherever they may be.

“Data Centers by Sweden has lots of compelling stories to tell and we’re thrilled to partner with them so those stories travel beyond Sweden’s borders,” says <person>David Landes</person>, The Local’s Head of Commercial Content.
