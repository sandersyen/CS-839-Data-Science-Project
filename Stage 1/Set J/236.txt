“Hungary is spending its money on families rather than on migrants,” Foreign Minister <person>Péter Szijjártó</person> said on Thursday, in reaction to critical remarks by a Swedish minister concerning the Hungarian government’s recent family assistance measures.

In a tweet, <person>Annika Strandhall</person>, the Swedish minister for social affairs, said that Hungary’s “alarming” policies were “reeking with the 1930’s”. She suggested the Hungarian prime minister, who seeks to promote the birth of “more true Hungarian” babies was a “right-wing populist trying to obscure the consequences of those policies to the independence women have earned”.

Contrary to Hungary, Sweden “spends money on migrants rather than on families”, <person>Szijjártó</person> said.
