In-form <person>Standard Li√®ge</person>, who hadn't suffered a single defeat in their last 7 games - posed a serious test for KRC Genk, but the Limburgers passed their exam with ease. Standard missed some players, both in midfield and in attack, and never gave the impression to be able to tackle Genk. 

However, the Limburgers had to wait until the second half to make the difference, when striker <person>Ali Samatta</person> scored a double. Genk now enjoy a 12-point advantage on second-placed Club Brugge, who will play neighbours Cercle Brugge this weekend. However, while 12 points may seem a lot, the points will be halved after 30 days of play as the teams enter the 10-day play-off 1 finale. 

Anderlecht, who are out of the top-6 at present, receive Zulte Waregem, also on Sunday.
