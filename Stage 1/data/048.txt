Hilton Hotels CEO <person>Christopher J Nassetta</person> clearly spends a lot of time on the road.
He was in New York City this week to announce a new line the century-old hotel company is launching later this year. Signia Hilton hotels -- the company's 17th brand -- aims to elevate conference hotels into a more modern, hipper experience.
<person>Nassetta</person> was on hand for a media Q-and-A session at a downtown Manhattan pop-up suite outfitted to look like a future Signia Hilton, with clean lines and metallic finishes more evocative of a Restoration Hardware store than a convention center hotel.
The northern Virginia native is credited with turning around Hilton. In 2007, private equity giant The Blackstone Group bought the company for $26 billion, and appointed <person>Nassetta</person> as chief operating officer (CEO).
