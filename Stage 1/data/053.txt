<person>Democrat Dan McCready</person>, who narrowly lost a congressional election in North Carolina's 9th district last year, announced Friday he will run for the seat again after the state board of elections voted to hold a new election following an investigation into widespread fraud in the 2018 race.
"I am running in the special election to represent the people of the 9th District," <person>McCready</person> told supporters Friday at a brewery outside of Charlotte. "I want to say right now that we are in this fight and we are going to win this fight."
"This is bigger than one race. This is bigger than one election. This is about what does it mean to live in a democracy," <person>McCready</person> added. "Our right to vote is our most sacred freedom as Americans."
<person>McCready</person> comes into the raise already a proven fundraiser, having raised $6.7 million for his 2018 race, and has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).
The timing of the new primary and general election in the 9th Congressional District will be decided at a meeting of the state board of elections. The timing of that meeting has not yet been announced.
