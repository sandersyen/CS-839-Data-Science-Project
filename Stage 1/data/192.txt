For a man who recently declared “I’m basically over”, <person>Stephen Malkmus</person> sounds surprisingly animated on his seventh album with the Jicks. Now 51, the former Pavement frontman still possesses the qualities that distinguished his years with the 90s band – an off-kilter sensibility and a love of language – but there is a newfound readiness to confront the iniquities of the real world. “Men are scum, I won’t deny,” he sings on the dreamy Middle America, a burst of fury built around an ageless chugging riff, while Bike Lane deals with the death of <person>Freddie Gray</person>, a victim of police brutality in Baltimore (“Kick off your jackboots, it’s time to unwind”).
Elsewhere, as if to underline his status as one of indie rock’s great eccentrics, <person>Malkmus</person> makes a decent fist of orchestral pop on the frisky, staccato-like Brethren, and severs all ties with conventional songwriting, revealing an aptitude for space rock (Difficulties/Let Them Eat Vowels). And if a duet with <person>Kim Gordon</person> (Refute) suggests that <person>Malkmus</person> wants to wallow in the past and reprise the woozy rock with which he made his name, its lilting country melody indicates otherwise.
