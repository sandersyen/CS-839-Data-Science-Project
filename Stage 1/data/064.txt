When first assistant state attorney <person>Risa Lanier</person> told <person>Lyke</person> that the actor had picked up two brothers who authorities say carried out the staged attack on him at his direction and showed them the location of where he wanted to be attacked, <person>Smollett</person> shook his head in disagreement.
When <person>Lyke</person> told <person>Smollett</person> that the allegations, if true, are "utterly outrageous," the actor nodded his head in agreement -- doing so again when <person>Lyke</person> said the noose detail would be the most despicable part of the alleged scheme.
The judge also ordered pre-trial monitoring of the actor, and ordered him to stay away from the two brothers he allegedly conspired with to stage the hoax attack, according to police.
