Q: Do you and A<person>li Davis</person> draw any personal parallels?
A: I identify with her fighting for what she believes she deserves. I mean, that's me in every contract deal, every negotiation for all the projects that I do. Men get paid more than women. That's just across the board. It's a fight I understand.
Q: Did you model <person>Ali</person> after anyone in your personal life?
A: My agent, <person>Tracey Jacobs</person> over at United Talent Agency (UTA). She was the first woman to sit on their board. But, you know agents -- at any kind of agency there are a lot of men. So, I talked to her a lot.
Q: Did your agent give you any advice on how to position the role?
A: No, not at all. I mean, when you're a woman in that position, and you've got to fight for what's yours, that's a no-brainer. You get to fighting, I've been a fighter all my life, so I didn't have to research that.
