Attorneys for <person>Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman</person> said the convicted drug kingpin will seek a new trial in light of an interview in which one of the jurors who convicted the notorious Mexican cartel leader admitted ignoring the judge's orders not to read media reports about the case.
"Mr. <person>Guzman</person> intends to file a motion for a new trial based on the disclosures in the article and to request and evidentiary hearing to determine the extent of the misconduct," <person>Guzman</person> attorneys said in a letter to the court on Friday.
The juror, who has not been identified, told VICE News in an exclusive interview that at least five members of the panel reviewed and discussed news reports and social media posts about the case during the trial and jury deliberations.
"You know how we were told we can't look at the media during the trial? Well, we did. <person>Jurors</person> did," the juror told VICE.
