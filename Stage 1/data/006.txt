Venezuela is in a tug of war for leadership between current President <person>Nicolas Maduro</person> and opposition leader <person>Juan Guaido</person>, who the U.S. has recognized as the rightful leader of the country. <person>Guaido</person> declared himself the country’s legitimate president on Jan. 23 following <person>Maduro</person>'s re-election in a race that many countries, including the U.S., have called fraudulent.

"The world can no longer close its eyes to this unacceptable situation," <person>Branson</person> wrote in a release. "While diplomatic efforts to bring in humanitarian goods must kick into high gear, we all need to mobilise much-needed financial support, and we need to do it quickly.
