<person>Reymar Perdomo</person>, a Venezuelan street singer who rose to fame for a video went viral showing her singing on buses in Peru, kicked off the concert with her signature song, "Me Fui," Spanish for "I left," which has become the unofficial anthem of the mass exodus.
<person>Perdomo</person> said performing so close to the border brought back painful memories.
"A little over a year ago I crossed this border and was robbed of my luggage and all my money," she said. "But I know in this moment that there will be change because Venezuelans want it and they are showing it today."
The plan to bring in aid is the most ambitious — and potentially dangerous — that the opposition has attempted to undertake since <person>Guaido</person> decided to challenge <person>Maduro</person>'s rule.
But the embattled socialist has shown no signs of backing down, and analysts warn that whatever happens over the next two days may not yield a conclusive victory for either side.
As if to highlight those risks, a woman from the combative Pemon tribe identified as <person>Zoraida Rodriguez</person> died from bullet wounds in clashes near the border with Brazil. Hours later, members of the Pemon tribe retaliated by taking control of the local airport, gateway to the world-famous Angel Falls. Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the demonstrators.
