A crucial turnover brought a sour end to <person>DeMar DeRozan</person>'s first game back in Toronto.
<person>Kawhi Leonard</person> stole the ball from <person>DeRozan</person> to score the go-ahead dunk with 15 seconds left and the Raptors beat the San Antonio Spurs 120-117 on Friday night, spoiling the former Toronto star's return to Canada.
"Tonight was like a playoff game," <person>Leonard</person> said. "We had to grind it out all the way to the end."
<person>Leonard</person> scored 19 of his 25 points in the second half, and combined with <person>Kyle Lowry</person> to strip <person>DeRozan</person> at midcourt before racing in alone for a one-handed slam.
"I knew they were going to be aggressive, trying to make a play on the ball and then foul," <person>DeRozan</person> said. "I've just got to be more aware."
Traded to San Antonio in the offseason deal that sent <person>Leonard</person> to Toronto, <person>DeRozan</person> received a warm welcome but was denied a second victory over his former team. He finished with 23 points.
