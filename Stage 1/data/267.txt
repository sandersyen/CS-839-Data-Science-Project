<person>Victoria</person> (<person>Alexandrina Victoria</person>; 24 May 1819 â€“ 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. On 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India.

<person>Victoria</person> was the daughter of Prince <person>Edward</person>, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King <person>George III</person>. Both the Duke and the King died in 1820, and <person>Victoria</person> was raised under close supervision by her mother, Princess <person>Victoria</person> of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no surviving legitimate children. The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy, in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, <person>Victoria</person> attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.

<person>Victoria</person> married her first cousin Prince <person>Albert</person> of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the sobriquet "the grandmother of Europe". After <person>Albert</person>'s death in 1861, <person>Victoria</person> plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration.

Her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than that of any of her predecessors and is known as the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, <person>Edward VII</person>, initiated the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father.
