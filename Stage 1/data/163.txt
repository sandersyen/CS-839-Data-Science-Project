While not a household name, Factory Floor – the band <person>Gabe Gurnsey</person> co-founded 13 years ago – owned their niche: sleek industrial techno cut with acid basslines made for a club-oriented live outfit, with intoning guitarist <person>Nik Void</person> recalling a robot Nico. <person>Gurnsey</person> insists that his debut solo album is a departure. It is, kind of: a saxophone line by <person>Peter Gordon</person> turns up on Sweet Heat. The club cultures he draws from here are markedly warmer than the stern clank of FF. A succinct funk bassline lurks inside You Can, and Harder Rhythm pays subtle homage to <person>Michael Jackson</person>. Really, though, <person>Gurnsey</person> remains consistent. A drummer by trade, his rhythms are unfailingly relentless. In Void’s absence, <person>Gurnsey</person>’s partner, <person>Matilda Morris</person>, provides vocal anomie. <person>Gurnsey</person> has structured Physical like a night out: driving to the club, stepping outside for a cigarette. But as with FF, Physical works as a seamless loop.
Not everything here is riveting: <person>Gurnsey</person>’s narrative arc is a little underdeveloped. Unlike your average dour beatmonger, however, <person>Gurnsey</person> has bags full of hooks. Heard a couple of times, Ultra Clear Sound’s refrain – “Crystal/ In the algorithm” – is hard to dislodge.
