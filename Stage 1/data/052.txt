The announcement from <person>McCready</person> comes the day after the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted unanimously on to hold a new election in the 9th Congressional District â€“ a move that came hours after <person>Mark Harris</person>, the Republican congressional candidate at the center of the case, testified.

"I believe a new election should be called," <person>Harris</person> said during the hearing, adding that his conclusion is based on the testimony he's heard over the last four days.
The timing and process of the new election are still unclear, as are details about candidates who might run. Those details will be determined by the board of elections at a later meeting.

While it's unclear whether Harris will run again in a new election, both men would have to compete in a primary election, according to a law passed by the GOP-controlled legislature late last year.
<person>McCready</person> tweeted Thursday following the board's decision saying, "Today was a great step forward for democracy in North Carolina."
