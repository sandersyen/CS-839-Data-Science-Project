There was a time, believe it or not, when people went to jazz clubs for a fun night out, and every venue, including the original <person>Ronnie Scott</person>’s, had a space for dancing. It’s less lively now, but no one’s smoking, so you can actually see the band from the back of the room. The connection between live jazz and having a good time isn’t dead yet though. In fact it’s enjoying something of a resurgence, with bands dedicated to freshening up items from the days when jazz was pop music, and <person>Fats Waller</person>, <person>Benny Goodman</person> et al were its superstars.
Jivin’ Miss Daisy, led by bassist <person>Simon Thorpe</person>, was one of the first in the field, with some distinguished names among its nine members. Their music is by no means an exact historical reconstruction. The tunes come mainly from the 1920s, 30s and 40s, while the arrangements have a decidedly 50s flavour, but it’s so well played, and the overall effect is so vivacious, that none of that matters. The swingers swing, the ballads float airily, and <person>Liz Fletcher</person>’s vocals catch just the right mood. Have yourself a fun night in.
