<person>Plato</person> was an Athenian philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece and the founder of the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy, along with his teacher, <person>Socrates</person>, and his most famous student, <person>Aristotle</person>.[n 1] <person>Alfred North Whitehead</person> once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to <person>Plato</person>."[4]

<person>Plato</person> has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality.[5] The so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry influenced Saint Augustine and thus Christianity.

<person>Plato</person> was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. <person>Plato</person> also appears to have been the founder of Western political philosophy. His most famous contribution bears his name, Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism), the doctrine of the Forms known by pure reason to provide a realist solution to the problem of universals. He is also the namesake of Platonic love and the Platonic solids.

His own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been along with <person>Socrates</person>, the pre-Socratics <person>Parmenides</person>, <person>Heraclitus</person> and <person>Pythagoras</person>, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from <person>Plato</person> himself.[n 2] Unlike the work of nearly all of his contemporaries, <person>Plato</person>'s entire oeuvre is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.[7] Although their popularity has fluctuated over the years, the works of <person>Plato</person> have never been without readers since the time they were written.
