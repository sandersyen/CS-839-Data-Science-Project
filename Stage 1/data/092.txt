The summit is slated for Wednesday and Thursday.
It gave no other details. The move implies that <person>Kim</person> may take a train and disembark at the Dong Dang railway station and proceed by car to Hanoi.
It is not known if he will travel by train from Pyongyang via China or fly to a nearby Chinese city. <person>Kim</person>'s overseas travel plans are routinely kept secret.
The People's Committee in Lang Son province, where the Dong Dang railway station is located, issued a statement Friday instructing the road operator to clean the stretch of the highway and suspend road works among other things to serve "a political task" on Feb. 24-28.
