"We are sickened by the comments she has made, but, as a family man yourself, we hope you will understand that we, as her family, cannot simply abandon her," her sister, <person>Renu Begum</person>, wrote in the letter to <person>Javid</person>.
"We hope you understand our position in this respect and why we must, therefore, assist <person>Shamima</person> in challenging your decision to take away the one thing that is her only hope at rehabilitation, her British citizenship," she added.
The situation with <person>Shamima Begum</person>'s citizenship is complex and will likely be argued in the courts. <person>Javid</person> has revoked her citizenship â€” even while he said he would not make a decision that would render a person stateless. Her family has insisted she is not a dual citizen.
