Reality star <person>Kim Kardashian West</person> is clapping back at brands she says are copying her latest looks for profit.
During this year's Hollywood Beauty Awards event, <person>West</person> wore a black vintage cutout dress from designer <person>Thierry Mugler</person>'s 1998 archives. The dress initially made headlines for being revealing, but now an identical version of it has surfaced on giant fashion retailer Fashion nova's website for $50 -- and it's already sold out.
Following news of the super-fast duplicate of the KKW Beauty founder's dress closely, popular Instagram account diet_prada pointed out that the model, <person>Yodit Yemane</person> -- who is wearing the replica -- leaked photos of herself modeling the look a few hours before it went for sale on their site under the label "Kim dress."
However, it was later posted on the site as the "Winning Beauty Cut Out Gown."
On Instagram, diet_prada asked the question: "Did Fashion nova whip up the dress overnight in their Los Angeles atelier after seeing <person>Kim</person> in it or is she peddling her vintage finds to mass retailers ahead of debuting them for a calculated, timely release?"
