<person>Francis Bacon</person>, 1st Viscount St Alban,[a] PC QC (/ˈbeɪkən/;[5] 22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626) was an English philosopher and statesman, who served as Attorney General and as Lord Chancellor of England. His works are credited with developing the scientific method, and remained influential through the scientific revolution.

<person>Bacon</person> has been called the father of empiricism.[6] His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes <person>Bacon</person> the father of the scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, <person>Bacon</person> was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories—history, poetry, and philosophy—which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings. <person>Bacon</person> was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge where he rigorously followed the medieval curriculum, largely in Latin.

<person>Bacon</person> is the first recipient of the Queen's counsel designation, which was conferred in 1597 when Queen <person>Elizabeth</person> reserved <person>Bacon</person> as her legal advisor. After the accession of King <person>James I</person> in 1603, <person>Bacon</person> was knighted. He was later created Baron Verulam in 1618[4] and Viscount St. Alban in 1621.[3][b] Because he had no heirs, both titles became extinct upon his death in 1626, at 65 years of age. Bacon died of pneumonia, with one account by <person>John Aubrey</person> stating that he had contracted the condition while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat. He is buried at St Michael's Church, St Albans, Hertfordshire.
