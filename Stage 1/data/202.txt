In a two-day EU conference that saw the subject of Brexit absorb most of the agenda, <person>Blair</person> warned that should the UK leave the EU, Britons would be powerless on its own against “giants” the US and China. In a special segment of the conference, the 65-year-old addressed Germany as part of the ‘Speakers Series’ that saw him call Brexit a “terrible historical mistake” before condemning the promises of Brexit advocates as being “100 percent wrong”. He added: “If I were Prime Minister, I would try to make it clear to the British that they only have the choice between a futile and a painful Brexit.” According to <person>Blair</person>, it would be pointless, just like Norway, to stay in close contact with the EU - without being able to have a say in the rules.

Seemingly mesmerised by the pro-EU ex politician’s speech, students at the University of Technology handed <person>Blair</person> a kit to brew Bavarian beer at home in preparation for Brexit - deal or no-deal.

As Prime Minister, <person>Blair</person> fought passionately for a European United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and made relentless attempts to get the UK to scrap the pound and have the euro currency instead.

He infamously told Newsnight's <person>Jeremy Paxman</person> in 2002 that he wanted to be the man who told the British people they should join the single currency and that a political rejection of the euro would be "crazy".
