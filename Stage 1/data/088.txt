It's not clear how <person>Guaido</person> sneaked into Colombia â€” in one video circulating on social media he appears running across a bridge near the Colombian town of Puerto Santander, while in another he could be seen boarding a helicopter belonging to the Colombian air force.
But once he arrived at the giant stage located next to the Tienditas bridge connecting the two countries he was greeted like a rock star himself. Thousands of Venezuelans shouted "<person>Juan</person> arrived! <person>Juan</person> arrived!" when they spotted him donning a white shirt and accompanied by a large contingent of Colombian security as he made himself through the front of the crowd.
The presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay were on hand to be the first foreign heads of state to embrace the 35-year-old lawmaker since he declared himself interim president a month ago at an outdoor rally.
The optimistic mood at the Live Aid-style concert opened in the Colombian border city of Cucuta couldn't mask underlying tensions a day before <person>Maduro</person>'s opponents embark on a risky strategy to undermine <person>Maduro</person> and bring in the aid being amassed along three of Venezuela's borders. But the crowd reacted with joy when <person>Guaido</person> suddenly appeared.
