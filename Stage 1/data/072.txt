This isn't the first time <person>Kardashian</person> has called out fast-fashion retailers for copying her style. Earlier this month, she posted a photo of herself in a fitted gold dress from her husband <person>Kanye West</person> along with a caption that included, "P.S. fast fashion brands, can you please wait until I wear this in real life before you knock it off?"
Coincidentally, diet_prada caught this too and posted a side-by-side photo of <person>Kardashian</person> in her gold dress next to a post from fashion retailer Missguided of a model in a look that was almost identical and noted to be dropping online in a few days.
<person>Kardashian</person>'s style has had an influence on many of her fans, and now, retailers seem just as impacted by her fashion choices.
