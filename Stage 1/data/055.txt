"Unless a parole board at some point... decides they should be released, they will serve the rest of their life in prison," <person>Hestrin</person> said.
Had the case gone to trial, the victims likely would have been called to testify, <person>Hestrin</person> said.
The seven adult children are "relieved" they won't face the possibility of testifying, <person>Jack Osborn</person>, a lawyer who represents the adult <person>Turpin</person> children, told ABC News on Friday. The victims didn't want to lose their privacy or relive the "trauma" in such a public setting, he explained.
<person>Hestrin</person> called the <person>Turpins</person>' case "among the worst, most aggravated child abuse cases that I have ever seen."
They were arrested after one child -- a 17-year-old girl -- escaped the home and called 911.
