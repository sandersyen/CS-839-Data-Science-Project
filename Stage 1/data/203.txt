The Swedish Academy's decision to award the 2013 <person>Nobel</person> Prize in Literature to <person>Alice Munro</person> was welcomed by writers including <person>AS Byatt</person>, <person>argaret Atwood</person> and <person>Jeffrey Eugenides</person>.

But perhaps unsurprisingly, American Psycho author <person>Bret Easton Ellis</person> took to Twitter this morning to make it clear that he isn't a fan of the 82-year-old Canadian.

"<person>Alice Munro</person> is so completely overrated," he wrote. "<person>Alice Munro</person> was always an overrated writer and now that she's won the <person>Nobel</person> she always will be. The <person>Nobel</person> is a joke and has been for ages."

In agreement with <person>Ellis</person> was <person>Christian Lorentzen</person>, a writer who penned a savage review of Munro's last short story collection, Dear Life, for the London Review of Books.

He tweeted <person>Ellis</person>, saying: "Amen." <person>Lorentzen</person> did, however, personally benefit from <person>Munro</person>'s win to the tune of £400 after placing a bet.

In the review, <person>Lorentzen</person> wrote: "Over a career now in its sixth decade, she's rehearsed the same themes again and again, but that's because she’s a master of variation. She has preternatural powers of sympathy and empathy, but she’s never sentimental."
