An album so wintry – the seventh from the English singer – makes an odd fit for high summer, but it’s a contradictory affair throughout, mixing songs that mourn <person>Oates</person>’s late father with others celebrating the birth of her daughter. <person>John Lennon</person>’s primal Mother is a brave cover choice, but <person>Oates</person>’s unaffected delivery, set to a sparse drone, lives up to the song’s harrowing demands. Elsewhere, the West Country singer tumbles through Edwardian lullabies and playground chants, Darwin Deez’s Constellations (given a girl choir), and traditional songs shared with her father – <person>Bill Caddick</person>’s Unicorns; <person>Hamish Henderson</person>’s Freedom Come All Ye.
The last is a lush piece of chamber folk with a stellar accompanying cast, but much of the album is spartan – voice, piano or guitar – recorded at home by producer and accomplice <person>Simon Richmond</person>, who understands ambience and knows when to leave a downbeat piece like Spring Is Coming Soon alone. The title track, by <person>Ewan MacColl</person>, is a bracing celebration of wild peaks and hills, being “drunk on air”. The varied material and <person>Oates</person>’s unfussy, melodic vocals pull us between sorrow and delight. A personal, affecting collection.
