<person>Adams</person>' attorney denies the accounts in the story, while <person>Adams</person> himself addressed the accusations on Twitter.
"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly," <person>Adams</person> wrote Wednesday, before calling the article "upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. Period."
<person>Adams</person> concluded: "As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly. I am resolved to work to be the best man I can be. And I wish everyone compassion, understanding and healing."
A request for comment from <person>Adams</person>' team was not immediately returned to ABC News.
