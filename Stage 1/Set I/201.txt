<person>Shamima Begum</person>, the Jihadi bride who fled Britain three years ago, has given birth in Syria, calling on the UK to be sympathetic to her plight.

The 19-year-old had a healthy baby boy at the al-Hawl refugee camp. She insisted there was no reason for him to be taken away from her as there was "no proof" she had done "anything dangerous”.

<person>Shamima</person>’s desire to return to the UK to bring up her child, coupled with an apparent lack of remorse or regret at her actions, has prompted a fierce debate over her future.

"I feel a lot of people should have sympathy for me, for everything I've been through, she told Sky News.

"I didn't know what I was getting into when I left, I just was hoping that maybe for the sake of me and my child they let me come back.

"I can't live in this camp forever. It's not really possible."

<person>Shamima</person> reiterated that she had no regrets about fleeing her home in Bethnal Green, east London, to support Islamic State, claiming the experience had made her “stronger, tougher”.

She said there was no evidence that she had done anything “dangerous” and that she had simply been living as a housewife, looking after her husband and two other children, who have since died.

"The entire four years I stayed at home, took care of my husband, took care of my kids, I never did anything... I never made propaganda, I never encouraged people to come to Syria," she said.

"They don't really have proof that I did anything that is dangerous."

Asked if she had a message for her family, she replied: “Keep trying to get me back. I don’t want to stay here. I’m afraid to look after my child in this country. I’m afraid he might even die in this camp.”

She said she wanted her son to have a better life and could “not see any reason” why he would be taken from her.

<person>Shamima</person> acknowledged that it would be “really hard” to be be rehabilitated  after everything she had been through, adding: ”I’m still in that mentality of planes over my head, emergency backpacks, starving...it would be a big shock to go back to the UK and start again.”


Her family has said that if she is jailed for supporting a terrorist group they want to step in to raise the child, rather than having the taxpayer pick up the cost.

<person>Muhammad Rahman</person>, 36, whose brother is married to <person>Shamima</person>’s elder sister <person>Renu</person>, told The Telegraph: “Her parents would want custody of the baby. They would want to look after their grandchild.

“I don’t think people, feeling the way many do about what <person>Shamima</person> has done, would want the state to pick up the burden of looking after the child.”

<person>Tasnime Akunje</person>, the family’s solicitor, revealed they had been told of the birth via "indirect contact" and that her parents were hoping to speak to her later today.

Asked whether relatives were planning to go to Syria in order to facilitate her return to the UK, he added: "The primary concern is getting Shamima back.

"Whether that involves them going there and bringing her back or working with structures here, we don't yet know."

<person>Ben Wallace</person>, the Home Office minister in charge of security, last week rebuffed <person>Shamima</person>'s plea to be rescued from the Syrian refugee camp where she is currently stranded, saying her "actions have consequences".

At the same time <person>Sajid Javid</person>, the Home Secretary, has said he would use all his available powers to prevent her return.

<person>Jeremy Wright</person>, the Culture Secretary, who previously served as attorney general, said on Sunday that the nationality of the child was a "difficult question", but added: "What really matters I think is to determine what should happen instantly and urgently to her because we do have to be concerned about the health of that baby, we have to be concerned about her health too.

"But in the end she will have to answer for her actions. So I think it is right that if she's able to come back to the UK that she does so but if she does so she will do it on the understanding that we can hold her to account for her behaviour thus far."
