The juror, who spoke to VICE, said the panelists were even anonymous to each other throughout the criminal proceedings and referred to one another by their juror numbers or nicknames that included, "<person>Pookie</person>," "<person>Mountain Dew</person>," "<person>Doc</person>," "<person>Crash</person>" and "<person>Starbucks</person>."
"We were saying how we should have our own reality TV show, like 'The Jurors on MTV' or something like that," the juror told VICE.
The juror said the deliberations went on for six days largely because of a single holdout and said some jurors expressed concern about <person>Guzman</person> being held in solitary confinement for the rest of his life if they found him guilty.
"A lot of people were having difficulty thinking about him being in solitary confinement, because, well, you know, we're all human beings, people make mistakes, et cetera," the juror told VICE.
<person>Guzman</person>, 61, was the leader of Sinaloa cartel, one of the most ruthless drug-smuggling organizations in Mexico. He has previously staged two elaborate escapes from Mexican prisons.
