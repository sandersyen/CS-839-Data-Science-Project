Norwich duo Let’s Eat Grandma’s 2016 debut, I, Gemini, written largely in their mid-teens, conjured a fey, Angela-Carter-does-avant-pop world of eldritch atmospheres, childlike vocals and jumbled styles. Those who found them too precious would be well advised to try again: two years on, <person>Rosa Walton</person> and <person>Jenny Hollingworth</person>’s leap forward is remarkable. The thrumming synths and eerily scraping cello of instrumental intro Whitewater build anticipation nicely for the revelation that is Hot Pink, co-produced by <person>Sophie</person> and the Horrors’ <person>Faris Badwan</person>, on which <person>Walton</person> and <person>Hollingworth</person>’s insouciant vocals are more than a match for angle-grinder electronics and rapid shifts of tone. After that delightful shock, the rest of the album reveals a less dramatic, but sharper, more focused new sound. Falling Into Me’s gorgeous rippling keys give way to a deliciously juddering chorus, while interludes such as The Cat’s Pyjamas (purring, wistful fairground organ) and Missed Call (nervy pizzicato strings) keep things odd between lush, twisted synth-dreampop numbers such as It’s Not Just Me and I Will Be Waiting. It’s a radical evolution that keeps true to their idiosyncratic voice, and amounts to a textbook example of how to do weird pop well.
