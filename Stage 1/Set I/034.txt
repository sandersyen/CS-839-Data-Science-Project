Boxing was a shared love for <person>Taraji P. Henson</person> and her father, <person>Boris</person>. The two verbally sparred over reach, weight class and which fighter deserved the champ belt -- official rankings were just a formality.
After her father died in 2006 from liver cancer, <person>Henson</person> kept his memory and the sport close to her heart. In the romantic comedy, "What Men Want," which released in theaters last week, <person>Henson</person> plays sports agent <person>Ali Davis</person> (the name is an homage to the original GOAT) who is not only navigating a male-dominated industry but rather, fighting to own a piece of it.
"When you're a woman in that position, you've got to fight for what's yours," said <person>Henson</person>, who recently received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. "I've been a fighter all my life, so I didn't have to research that."
