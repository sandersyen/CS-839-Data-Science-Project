<person>Constantine the Great</person>, also known as <person>Constantine I</person>, was a Roman Emperor who ruled between 306 and 337 AD. Born on the territory now known as Niš (Serbian Cyrillic: Ниш, located in Serbia), he was the son of <person>Flavius Valerius Constantius</person>, a Roman Army officer. His mother was Empress <person>Helena</person>. His father became Caesar, the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. <person>Constantine</person> was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under Emperors <person>Diocletian</person> and <person>Galerius</person>. In 305, <person>Constantius</person> was raised to the rank of Augustus, senior western emperor, and <person>Constantine</person> was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). <person>Constantine</person> was acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD. He emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors <person>Maxentius</person> and <person>Licinius</person> to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD.

As emperor, <person>Constantine</person> enacted administrative, financial, social, and military reforms to strengthen the empire. He restructured the government, separating civil and military authorities. To combat inflation he introduced the solidus, a new gold coin that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years. The Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.
