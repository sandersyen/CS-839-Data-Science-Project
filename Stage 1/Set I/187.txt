From Bon Iver to the Weeknd via our own <person>James Blake</person>, sad boys have stamped their imprimatur on the early years of this century. The latest exponent finds the subgenre subtly levelling up. <person>Jamie Isaac</person> is a classically trained multi-instrumentalist infused with the smoky sensibility of south London – the bass of dubstep, the loneliness of the night bus – as well as jazz and granular digitals. His 2016 debut, Couch Baby, found the twentynothing lolling on soft furnishings, yearning and regretting.
This sequel, written in sunny California and recorded with a full band in London, throws open the curtains a little, taking <person>Isaac</person> closer to the mainstream. Songs such as Maybe re-introduce him as a jazz-pop loverman, an unlikely heir to Sade; Doing Better actually swings. Wings, meanwhile, leans on bossanova rhythms. True to its roots, the song starts off watching a girl gnawing on chicken. (04:30) Idler/Sleep is intended to soundtrack night-time journeys – <person>Isaac</person>’s insomnia is a major inspiration – but the headspace remains interior, with Doppler-effect burbles and inhales adding to the atmosphere. These aren’t vast nocturnal canvases, but immersive miniatures that repay close attention.
