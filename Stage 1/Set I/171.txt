Berlin-based electronic artist <person>Lotic</person> is from the school of fractured beat-makers like <person>Arca</person>, <person>Sophie</person> and <person>Elysia Crampton</person> who elude genre and gender boundaries – and whose blunt, mechanistic club creations are not for the faint of heart. According to <person>Lotic</person>, who prefers to use the pronoun “they”, their debut album is less abrasive than previous material, making the unlistenable danceable. Bulletproof’s toppling drums suggest a ninja running across rooftops, while The Warp and the Weft is the gnarliest attack of gabba since DJ <person>Scotch Egg</person>. Hunted, meanwhile, is an intriguing slice of ghostly gospel with sinister whispers of “brown skin, masculine frame/ head’s a target”.
It’s easy to hear why <person>Björk</person> is a fan: <person>Lotic</person>’s baroque shimmer-strings have a similar synthetically sweet quality to <person>Arca</person>’s co-production on her albums Vulnicura and Utopia. And like Vulnicura – as track titles such as Resilience, with its chainsaw-savage groove, and smoky ballad Solace suggest – this is an album about finding inner strength. The result is a fearless and powerful debut.
