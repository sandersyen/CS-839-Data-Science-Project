<person>Trump</person> tweeted, "Be nice if <person>Spike Lee</person> could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres!"
When <person>Lee</person> accepted the award for best adapted screenplay for "BlacKkKlansman," his speech did not mention <person>Trump</person> by name, but did urge voters to mobilize for the 2020 election.
"Before the world tonight, I give praise to our ancestors who have built this country into what it is today along with the genocide of its native people," <person>Lee</person> said. "We all connect with our ancestors. We will have love and wisdom regained, we will regain our humanity."
