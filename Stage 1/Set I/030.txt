Fox attacks <person>Blair</person>'s <person>Tory</person> 'lies'

<person>Tony Blair</person> lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign, say the Tories.

Tory co-chairman <person>Liam Fox</person> was speaking after Mr <person>Blair</person> told Labour members the Tories offered a "hard right agenda". Dr <person>Fox</person> told BBC Radio: "If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all." He would not discuss reports the party repaid Â£500,000 to Lord <person>Ashcroft</person> after he predicted an election defeat.
