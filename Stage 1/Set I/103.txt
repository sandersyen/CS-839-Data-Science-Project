Despite boasting the gravitas of tectonic plates rubbing together, the tuba is not usually a lead instrument. Fyah, though, is tuba don <person>Theon Cross</person>’s debut solo album. The Sons of <person>Kemet</person> tubist alternates between rhythm and lead, and when he’s not the star of the track, ensemble players circle around the gravitational pull of <person>Cross</person>’s rumble-tone. Several instrumental voices are familiar on Fyah, where a debt to Caribbean-adjacent south London sounds such as calypso and drum’n’bass is palpable. Fellow hot-horn <person>Nubya Garcia</person> on tenor sax and drum stalwart <person>Moses Boyd</person> figure extensively; honourable mentions, too, to guitarist <person>Artie Zaitz</person> and alternate sax player <person>Wayne Francis</person>, also of the famed <person>Steam Down</person> improv nights.
As with <person>Kemet</person>, the tracklisting provides a history lesson. Album highlight Candace of Meroe – a brisk, highlife-inflected workout that demands dancing – is named after the ancient queens of the Ethiopian/Sudanese region. You struggle to comprehend how the extraordinary sounds near its inception are coming out of a tuba (via a wah-wah effect). On The Offerings and Radiation, Cross’s prowling tone is slung so low as to sound filthy. One can only hope his lips and lungs are insured.
