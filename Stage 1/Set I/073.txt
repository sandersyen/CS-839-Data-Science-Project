Shortly after the fast-fashion fiasco, the 38-year-old <person>Kardashian West</person> took to Twitter to voice her thoughts.
"It’s devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas."
The rant continues with a series of tweets, where one addresses her vintage Mugler dress directly.
"Only two days ago, I was privileged enough to wear a one-of-a-kind vintage Mugler dress and in less than 24 hours it was knocked off and thrown up on a site - but it's not for sale. You have to sign up for a waitlist because the dress hasn’t even been made to sell yet."
"So, as always, don’t believe everything you read and see online," <person>Kardashian</person> said in another tweet. "I don’t have any relationships with these sites. I’m not leaking my looks to anyone, and I don’t support what these companies are doing."
