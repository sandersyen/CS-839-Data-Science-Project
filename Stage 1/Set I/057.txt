<person>Holly Catlin</person> said she has personally heard from 25 or 30 disabled Walmart greeters who told her they have lost their jobs.
"What makes me really sad is if we fix this for <person>Adam</person>, there are still those 25 or 30 people who are still out of a job and don't know where to turn. It makes me sick," she said. "I feel I need to go to bat for them."
