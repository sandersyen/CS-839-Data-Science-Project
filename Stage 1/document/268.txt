Prince <person>Albert</person> of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was the husband of Queen <person>Victoria</person>.

He was born in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family connected to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen <person>Victoria</person>; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him power or responsibilities. He gradually developed a reputation for supporting public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.

<person>Victoria</person> came to depend more and more on his support and guidance. He aided the development of Britain's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with Parliamentâ€”although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston's tenure as Foreign Secretary. In 1857, <person>Albert</person> was given the formal title of Prince Consort.

<person>Albert</person> died at the relatively young age of 42. <person>Victoria</person> was so devastated at the loss of her husband that she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life. On her death in 1901, their eldest son succeeded as <person>Edward VII</person>, the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, named after the ducal house to which <person>Albert</person> belonged.
