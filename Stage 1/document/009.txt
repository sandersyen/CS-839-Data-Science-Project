The students picked their own costumes, did the styling, and posing all on their own. <person>Sims</person> snapped most of the photos (except for a few which he let a student interested in photography take) and then photoshopped them to look like the book covers. He said each image took around an hour to produce.
Student <person>Brooklyn Jones</person> who posed as <person>Michelle Obama</person> said, " It was inspiring to me and made me feel like I was stepping in her shoes. It made me want to learn more about her and inspired me to help out with [my] community."
