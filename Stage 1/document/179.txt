<person>Emile Parisien</person> was artist in residence at last summer’s Jazz in Marciac season in south-west France, and by all accounts this was its outstanding concert. It was also very French, not least in the enigmatic title of his three-part suite Le Clown Tueur de la Fête Foraine, which I translate as “The Killer-Clown Of The Funfair”. <person>Parisien</person> plays the wayward soprano saxophone with the negligent grace that comes only with exceptional technique. His quintet here includes the German virtuoso pianist <person>Joachim Kühn</person> and the combination, while remarkable, can be a bit overwhelming. On the other hand, among the guests is the accordionist <person>Vincent Peirani</person>, whose melodic flair and lightness of touch make his playing a permanent delight, and <person>Wynton Marsalis</person>, who apparently takes his summer vacation at Marciac. He and <person>Parisien</person> perform a fiendishly difficult-sounding, yet gloriously funny version of Temptation Rag that seems to have stolen the show. The CD comes with a DVD of the concert, containing a couple of extra numbers. Sfumato, the title of <person>Parisien</person>’s 2017 album, refers to a painting technique to suggest indistinctness. There’s another enigma.
