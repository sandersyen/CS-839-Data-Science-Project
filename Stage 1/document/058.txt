Walmart said it's working with <person>Catlin</person> on a resolution.
"We recognize this is a unique situation and it will take time to explore possible solutions. As we phase the greeter role out of this store over a 60-day period, our store management and local human resource teams will be in regular contact with <person>Adam</person> and his family as we explore every available option to him," said Walmart spokesman <person>Kory Lundberg</person>. "We will be thoughtful during the process in hopes of finding a way for <person>Adam</person> to stay with the store."
At least a dozen disabled Walmart greeters in seven states — Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin — say they were pushed out the door, forced to accept lower pay or otherwise harmed when the retailer replaced the greeter job with host, according to the National Disability Rights Network, whose state affiliates are working with impacted employees, and in some cases suing Walmart.
