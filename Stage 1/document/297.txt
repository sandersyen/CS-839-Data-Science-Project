<person>Muzio Filippo Vincenzo Francesco Saverio Clementi</person> (23 January 1752 â€“ 10 March 1832) was an Italian-born English composer, pianist, pedagogue, conductor, music publisher, editor, and piano manufacturer.

Encouraged to study music by his father, he was sponsored as a young composer by Sir <person>Peter Beckford</person> who took him to England to advance his studies. Later, he toured Europe numerous times from his long-standing base in London. It was on one of these occasions, in 1781, that he engaged in a piano competition with <person>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</person>.

Influenced by <person>Domenico Scarlatti</person>'s harpsichord school and <person>Haydn</person>'s classical school and by the stile galante of <person>Johann Christian Bach</person> and <person>Ignazio Cirri</person>, <person>Clementi</person> developed a fluent and technical legato style, which he passed on to a generation of pianists, including <person>John Field</person>, <person>Johann Baptist Cramer</person>, <person>Ignaz Moscheles</person>, <person>Giacomo Meyerbeer</person>, <person>Friedrich Kalkbrenner</person>, <person>Johann Nepomuk Hummel</person> and <person>Carl Czerny</person>. He was a notable influence on <person>Ludwig van Beethoven</person>.

<person>Clementi</person> also produced and promoted his own brand of pianos and was a notable music publisher. Because of this activity, many compositions by <person>Clementi</person>'s contemporaries and earlier artists have stayed in the repertoire. Though the European reputation of <person>Muzio Clementi</person> was second only to <person>Joseph Haydn</person> in his day, his reputation languished for much of the 19th and 20th centuries.
