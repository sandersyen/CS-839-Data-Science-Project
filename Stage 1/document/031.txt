And finally, when <person>Lucious</person> (<person>Henson</person>'s love interest in "Empire," played by <person>Terrence Howard</person>), was coming back into <person>Cookie</person>'s life, they wanted her to jump right in, and I was like, "no, no, no. He has to work for this. I get that ya'll are trying to get that this is real love and sometimes relationships get stretched like a rubber band, and then sometimes you find yourselves back together, but he's got to work."
You can't. What message are we sending to women? I don't want that. That's not the message I'm trying to send, because that's not the woman I am. I don't do that. So, I try to teach that lesson through my work. And even with <person>Ali</person> in this film, I was like, "This can't be a movie about her finding her success through a man." She's going to change herself, find herself, love herself first. Then the man can come, and everybody agreed to that.
That's putting too much power in another human's hands. Why would you do that?
