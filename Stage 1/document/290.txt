<person>Johannes Kepler</person> was a German astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer. He is a key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution, best known for his laws of planetary motion, and his books Astronomia nova, Harmonices Mundi, and Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae. These works also provided one of the foundations for <person>Newton</person>'s theory of universal gravitation.

<person>Kepler</person> was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, where he became an associate of Prince <person>Hans Ulrich</person> von Eggenberg. Later he became an assistant to the astronomer <person>Tycho Brahe</person> in Prague, and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor <person>Rudolf II</person> and his two successors <person>Matthias</person> and <person>Ferdinand II</person>. He also taught mathematics in Linz, and was an adviser to General <person>Wallenstein</person>. Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, invented an improved version of the refracting telescope (the Keplerian telescope), and was mentioned in the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary <person>Galileo Galilei</person>. He was a corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.[4]

<person>Kepler</person> lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) and physics (a branch of natural philosophy). <person>Kepler</person> also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason.[5] <person>Kepler</person> described his new astronomy as "celestial physics",[6] as "an excursion into <person>Aristotle</person>'s Metaphysics",[7] and as "a supplement to <person>Aristotle</person>'s On the Heavens",[8] transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.
