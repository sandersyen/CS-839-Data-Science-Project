Tension between the New York City natives came to a head on their home turf during Fashion Week last fall when <person>Cardi</person> and <person>Minaj</person> reportedly got into a physical altercation at <person>Harper</person>'s Bazaar Icons party. Since then, the two vowed to keep things between them positive.
