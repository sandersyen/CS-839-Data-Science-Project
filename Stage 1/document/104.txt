A poignant moment, with Brexit looming, to contemplate this vivid example of what was possible 27 years ago. In July 1992, jazz composer <person>Mike Westbrook</person>, with 24 musicians, plus crew and guests, flew to Catania, Sicily, for a three-evening festival of <person>Westbrook</person>’s music. It took place in the open air, in the heart of the city, and admission was free.
The music on this double CD has been garnered from surviving tapes and cassettes made at the time, although the quality is remarkably good. Most of it comes from the evening devoted to what <person>Westbrook</person> called his European Song Book, including settings of poems by <person>Lorca</person> and <person>Blake</person>, and arrangements of songs by <person>Brecht</person> and <person>Weill</person>. There’s also a bravura treatment of It Don’t Mean a Thing, with phenomenal soprano saxophone from <person>Peter Whyman</person>. In fact, this was a cracking good band altogether, combining old <person>Westbrook</person> hands such as <person>Whyman</person> and fellow saxophonist <person>Chris Biscoe</person> with brilliant newcomers like <person>Alan Barnes</person> (alto saxophone and clarinet) and vibraphonist <person>Anthony Kerr</person>. Recalling the event, <person>Westbrook</person> writes that the Catania festival was “the best gift a composer ever had”.
