"Sitting here four days into this meeting ... my son was a bit prophetic in his statement that day," <person>Harris</person> said of his son <person>John</person>'s warning about <person>McCrae Dowless</person>, the political hand accused of running an illegal absentee ballot collecting scheme in the state's 9th Congressional District.
That warning was revealed in testimony on Wednesday and came in a phone conversation and later an e-mail in April 2017, after <person>John Harris</person> said he discovered abnormalities in absentee vote totals in one rural Bladen County, North Carolina.
Despite the warnings, <person>Mark Harris</person> eventually hired <person>Dowless</person> to do absentee ballot and other campaign work.

<person>Harris</person> won the 2018 election in the district by 905 votes, but after concerns were raised by the North Carolina State Board of Elections about potential election fraud, the result was not certified, leaving the seat vacant and hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians without representation in the U.S. House.
