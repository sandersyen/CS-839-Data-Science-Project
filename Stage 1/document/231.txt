The dream is over. The Belgian tennis team was defeated by France in Liège, 0-3 after 3 of the 5 matches. 

Things had started off the wrong way yesterday, when <person>Alison Van Uytvanck</person> was defeated by <person>Caroline Garcia</person> in 3 sets. <person>Elise Mertens</person>, the world's number 21, made her big debut for the Belgian team in the second match but failed to move past in-form <person>Alizé Cornet</person>, who came out on top in straight sets, 6-7, 2-6. The opening set was a hard battle in which Mertens failed to take several opportunities, which may have been a mental blow. 

In today's first game, all pressure was on <person>Mertens</person>' shoulders when she needed a win to keep Belgium in the game. However, <person>Garcia</person>, the world's number 19, proved too strong: 2-6, 3-6. 

Belgium will now have to play Romania in April, in a play-off tie to stay in the World Group.
