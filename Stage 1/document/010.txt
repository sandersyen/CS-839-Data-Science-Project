For this year's project <person>Sims</person> told "Good Morning America" that the now-viral book cover recreations were the students' idea.
“I think it’s really important that we know who we are so that way we know how we’re supposed to exist in the community today. I think it’s very important that my kids are getting access to that at a young age,” <person>Sims</person> told GMA.
One of <person>Sims</person>' main goals throughout his viral projects is to figure out how to get the students to “love themselves and fall in love with the process of learning at the same time.” A theme that is woven into many of his projects and helps to bring up conversations of culture and identity in the classroom.
<person>Sims</person> is able to create deep connections with his students through his creative teaching styles and role as a mentor in their lives.
<person>Sims</person> and his students never expected to go viral with this project, and are know using this as an opportunity to get more students to join the book club. As for the staff of Milwaukee College Prep and the parents of the students, <person>Sims</person> says they willing rally around him for these projects because they trust his direction,“They see that I really put the focus on relationship building with the students and it’s not just for show. They like the fact that it’ll push their students further.” The kids are inspired by how far their story has reached and <person>Sims</person> says they’re bringing fresh eyes and more creative ideas to the table.
As for <person>Sims</person>, he just wants to “inspire his students to be great,” while continuing to find creative ways to make learning fun and impactful for his students. He is already noticing an uptick in his student’s energy and eagerness to learn about these essential topics. "Everything that makes me happy now came from education, so if I can just be in the classroom and get people to love themselves and to love education - I really think the possibilities are limitless."
