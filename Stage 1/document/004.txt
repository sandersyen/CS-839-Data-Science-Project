Another founding member of the group, <person>Denise Buchanan</person>, a native of Jamaica, said a priest raped and assaulted her when she was 17.
"That rape actually resulted in a pregnancy, and the priest arranged for an abortion," <person>Buchanan</person> said.
Watcher <person>Marco Politi</person> told the AP he also sees the pope facing inside resistance.
"There is a struggle going on between the pope and his supporters who want a change, and a lot of people among the bishops and among the clergy who don't want transparency and applying law and order in the abuse issue in the world," <person>Politi</person> said.
Some of <person>Francis</person>'s critics contend that as a product of the Catholic Church's hierarchical culture, he, too, has been slow to recognize the hierarchy's role in perpetuating abuse by pedophile priests.
<person>Francis</person> has tried to temper expectations for the summit, saying in January the "problem of abuse will continue" because "it's a human problem." <person>Isely</person> said the bar should be high and the participants "have to deliver for survivors."
