North Carolina Democrats said the evidence revealed at the nearly four-day hearing shows <person>Harris</person> knew far more about the allegedly illicit scheme than he previously disclosed.
"Over an extraordinary four-day hearing, investigators laid out point by point how Republican <person>Mark Harris</person>' campaign funded and directed an elaborate, illegal scheme to steal an election," North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman <person>Wayne Goodwin</person> wrote in a statement. "This saga could only have ended in a new election, and we look forward to repairing the harm dealt by Republicans and giving the people of the Ninth district the representative they deserve."
Republicans thanked the State Board of Elections and said they'll do what they can to ensure that "these kinds of situations can be avoided in the future."
