The king originally wanted a rifle instead of a guitar, but his mother made sure he didn’t get his hands on one. Of course, that would prove to play in his advantage. As you’ll learn, though, <person>Presley</person> would never lose his interest in firearms.
By the time <person>Elvis</person> made it big, people all over the world wanted to get a piece of him. He was selling out shows throughout the United States singing “Heartbreak Hotel” and “That’s All Right,” but unfortunately for his fans overseas, they’d have to keep waiting.
While <person>Presley</person> performed in Canada in 1957, he never played outside of North America. It’s curious that the most popular musician of the time didn’t tour the world, and there are many speculations as to why he didn’t. Some of those speculations have to do with his manager, about whom you’ll soon learn more.
It’s pretty well-known that <person>Elvis Presley</person> took a break from his music career when he was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958 – something almost unimaginable for a star to do today. And the move gained him much respect from his haters.

When he was drafted, <person>Presley</person> refused an offer to live in priority housing. Opting instead to serve as a regular soldier, he won over an initially skeptical segment of America that first saw him as a negative cultural influence. He would win over someone else during his time in the army, too.
