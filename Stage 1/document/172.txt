<person>RP Boo</person> is dubbed “the unsung godfather” of footwork, the hyperfast ghetto-house mutation and dance style that’s been quickening Chicago’s step since the early 90s. But though the scene came to wider attention a decade ago, <person>Boo</person> is only now making his debut studio album. As he ad libs on opener No Body: “I’ll get the turntables, you get the floor”. His battle tracks are still written with dancers in mind, combining frenetic polyrhythms, spartan, skittering drums, shadowy paranoia and dense tapestries of samples.
It’s an album designed to destroy pacemakers, but the most interesting tracks tend to slow down the tempo. Earth’s Battle Dance has a beat that feels ritualistic, like it’s trying to conjure spirits, before dropping into laidback soul. Back from the Future sounds like a bleak sex jam; and U-Don’t No provides a contemplative moment of melancholy. I’ll Tell You What! doesn’t have quite the same crossover potential as <person>Jlin</person>, whose Black Origami album on Planet Mu topped almost every best electronic album list last year. But it’s a definitive statement of a sound that has staying power – and packs a triple-speed punch.
