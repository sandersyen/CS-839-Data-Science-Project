<person>Galileo Galilei</person> was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath.[4] <person>Galileo</person> has been called the "father of observational astronomy",[5] the "father of modern physics",[6][7] the "father of the scientific method",[8] and the "father of modern science".[9][10]

<person>Galileo</person> studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances", inventing the thermoscope and various military compasses, and using the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn and the analysis of sunspots.

<person>Galileo</person>'s championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.[11] He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar parallax.[11] The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture."[11][12][13] <person>Galileo</person> later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope <person>Urban VIII</person> and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported <person>Galileo</person> up until this point.[11] He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[14][15] While under house arrest, he wrote Two New Sciences, in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.
