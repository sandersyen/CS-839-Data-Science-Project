After the concert, Venezuela's Vice President <person>Delcy Rodriguez</person> said her government was ordering the partial closure of the border with Colombia hours ahead of the planned delivery of the humanitarian aid.
<person>Rodriguez</person> said on Twitter that the government was temporarily closing three crossings in Tachira state because of the "serious and illegal threats" against Venezuela's peace and sovereignty coming from Colombia's government.
At the concert venue, the feeling was one of collective catharsis, especially for migrants who in recent years have fled Venezuela's economic implosion by crossing into Colombia. Under a scorching sun, those in attendance waved Venezuelan flags, squirted water at each other and swayed to music by marquee artists including Colombia's <person>Carlos Vives</person> and Mexican rock band Mana as well as a host of Venezuelan performers.
