After being tipped for a breakthrough at the start of 2016, Essex-based <person>Jordan Cardy</person> allowed much of the hype surrounding him to dissipate by not releasing his debut album until 18 months later. While Scum was a decent enough amalgam of skate punk dynamics, big chanted choruses and <person>Jamie T</person> estuary English, it was hamstrung by an over-reliance on tiresome skits. The follow-up is a big improvement, thanks in part to <person>Tim</person> “Operation Ivy/Rancid” <person>Armstrong</person>’s production.
There are certainly echoes of <person>Rancid</person>’s ska inflections on the likes of Don’t Hesitate, and <person>Armstrong</person> himself provides vocals on No Peace No Justice; the punchy melodies of Wavves are also a reference point on I Wanna Skate. Elsewhere, the pace drops, as on the gently skanking Night Creature. Follow Your Heart, meanwhile, sounds like nothing so much as <person>Damon Albarn</person> essaying a brass-assisted cover of the Vaselines’ Son of a Gun (a song best known for <person>Nirvana</person>’s version). <person>Cardy</person>’s lyrics are still a slight disappointment, however, consisting too often of ill-defined “us v them” sentiments (witness So What’s “They don’t care about us so we don’t care about them”). Still, that’s a minor quibble – it’s hard not to enjoy an album as full of energy as this.
